# Road-accident-analysis

Road Accident Dashboard for 2021 and 2022 This project aims to create a road accident dashboard using Power BI for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard will provide insights into various aspects of road accidents based on the provided requirements. The primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include Total Casualties and Total Accidents, Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the current year, and Total Casualties with respect to Vehicle Type. The dashboard will also include Monthly Trend analysis, Casualties by Road Type, Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night, and Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location.

Functionalities in Power BI The following functionalities in Power BI will be utilized to create the dashboard:

Loading of CSV file: The road accident data for 2021 and 2022 will be loaded from a CSV file into Power BI for analysis.

Data cleaning using Power BI: Power BI provides various data transformation and cleaning tools to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data for analysis.

Time intelligence function: Power BI offers built-in time intelligence functions to perform calculations and comparisons based on date/time fields. This will be useful for analyzing the Monthly Trend and other time-based analyses.

Creating KPIs: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be defined in Power BI to track and visualize the primary metrics, such as Total Casualties and Total Accidents, and Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the current year.

Grouping: Power BI allows grouping of data based on specific attributes, such as Vehicle Type, Road Type, and Location, which will help in analyzing Casualties with respect to Vehicle Type, Casualties by Road Type, and Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location.

Creating a dashboard: Power BI provides a user-friendly interface to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. Visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps will be used to present the analysis results.

Deriving insights from the dashboard: The created dashboard will enable the clients to derive insights from the analyzed data, such as identifying accident hotspots, understanding the severity of accidents, analyzing monthly trends, and identifying areas for improvement in terms of road safety.
